## Conclusion

In this laboratory work I have strengthened my knowledge of the MVC pattern. Phoenix provides a great environment for MVC
web apps. While most of the code is scaffolded in this laboratory work, most of it will probably be removed/rewritten in the
future to fit the needs of the application. The most difficult part of this laboratory work was understanding brunch and getting
the static assets (bootstrap and jquery) to work.
